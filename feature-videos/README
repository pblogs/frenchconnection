When creating or changing something in the view, please make a quick video of 
how it works from a user's perspective.

This is how you make a recording in QuickTime Player for Mac:
File, New Screen Recording.

Save the video to "$RAILS_ROOT/feature-videos/#{pull_request_id}-#{description}.mov"
.mov is just an example, use a format that most people can open.
